A magnitude comparator is a digital circuit that compares the magnitude (size) of two binary numbers.

*Types of Comparators:*

1. Equality Comparator (checks if two numbers are equal)
2. Greater-Than Comparator (checks if one number is greater than another)
3. Less-Than Comparator (checks if one number is less than another)
4. Magnitude Comparator (checks equality, greater-than, and less-than simultaneously)

*Magnitude Comparator Functionality:*

1. Compares two binary numbers, A and B
2. Produces three output signals:
    - A=B (equality)
    - A>B (greater-than)
    - A<B (less-than)

*Truth Table:*

| A   | B   | A=B | A>B | A<B |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   |

*VHDL Code:*

```
vhdl
entity magnitude_comparator is
    Port ( A : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (n-1 downto 0);
           B : in  STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (n-1 downto 0);
           A_eq_B : out  STD_LOGIC;
           A_gt_B : out  STD_LOGIC;
           A_lt_B : out  STD_LOGIC);
end magnitude_comparator;

architecture Behavioral of magnitude_comparator is
begin
    A_eq_B <= '1' when A = B else '0';
    A_gt_B <= '1' when A > B else '0';
    A_lt_B <= '1' when A < B else '0';
end Behavioral;
```
