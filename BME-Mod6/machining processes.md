**Turning** is a machining operation that involves rotating a workpiece while a cutting tool moves in a linear motion. This process is used to create cylindrical, tapered, and spherical parts. A **lathe** is the machine of choice for all turning operations¹.

**Drilling** is a machining operation that involves creating holes in a workpiece. This process is used to make holes, tap threads, and countersink¹. A **drilling machine** is used for drilling operations⁵.

**Milling** is a machining operation that involves removing material from a workpiece using a rotating cutting tool. This process is used to create flat, curved, and angular surfaces¹. A **milling machine** is used for milling operations⁵.

**Grinding** is a machining operation that involves removing material from a workpiece using an abrasive wheel. This process is used to sharpen tools, finish surfaces, and remove material¹.

**CNC (Computer Numerical Control)** machines are programmable machines capable of performing CNC machining operations autonomously. They are used for a variety of machining operations and are available in different configurations such as CNC mills and CNC lathes⁵. Here is a block diagram of a CNC machine:
