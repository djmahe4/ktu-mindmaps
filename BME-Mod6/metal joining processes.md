**Welding** is a metal joining process in which two or more parts are joined or coalesced at their contacting surfaces by suitable application of heat or/and pressure. It can be broadly classified into two types: **fusion welding** and **solid state welding**. Some of the common types of welding include arc welding, resistance welding, oxyfuel gas welding, electron beam welding, and laser welding¹. Welding is used to create strong and permanent joints in a variety of applications such as automotive parts, aerospace parts, and shipbuilding¹.

**Soldering** is a metal joining process that uses a filler metal to join two or more metal parts together. The filler metal melts at a lower temperature than the base metal and forms a bond between the parts. Soldering is commonly used in electronics, plumbing, and jewelry making¹.

**Brazing** is a metal joining process that uses a filler metal to join two or more metal parts together. The filler metal melts at a higher temperature than the base metal and forms a bond between the parts. Brazing is commonly used in automotive parts, aerospace parts, and HVAC systems¹.

I hope this helps!
