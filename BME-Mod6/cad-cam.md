## CAD/CAM Mind Map (ASCII Art)

**Central Topic:** CAD/CAM (Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing)

**Branches:**

1. **Computer-Aided Design (CAD):**
    * **Description:** Creating digital models of products using 2D and 3D software.
    * **Features:**
        * **Geometric modeling:** Defining shapes and dimensions of objects.
        * **Assembly modeling:** Combining parts to create complex structures.
        * **Simulation and analysis:** Testing virtual prototypes for performance and manufacturability.
        * **Technical documentation:** Generating drawings, specifications, and production instructions.
    * **Benefits:**
        * **Improved design accuracy and efficiency.**
        * **Reduced development time and cost.**
        * **Enhanced collaboration and communication.**
        * **Better product quality and manufacturability.**

2. **Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM):**
    * **Description:** Using CAD data to control manufacturing processes.
    * **Features:**
        * **CNC programming:** Generating instructions for computer-controlled machines.
        * **Toolpath generation:** Defining the path of cutting tools for machining operations.
        * **Material selection and optimization:** Choosing the right materials and minimizing waste.
        * **Process simulation and verification:** Testing manufacturing processes virtually before production.
    * **Benefits:**
        * **Increased production automation and efficiency.**
        * **Improved product quality and consistency.**
        * **Reduced material waste and production costs.**
        * **Enhanced flexibility and adaptability.**

3. **Integration:**
    * **Direct link between CAD and CAM:** Seamless transfer of design data for efficient manufacturing.
    * **Benefits:**
        * **Reduced errors and rework.**
        * **Shorter lead times and faster production.**
        * **Improved overall product development process.**
