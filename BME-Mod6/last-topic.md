**CAD/CAM** stands for computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing. It is a process that uses computer software to design and manufacture products. CAD software is used to create a digital design of the product, while CAM software is used to control the manufacturing process¹.

**Rapid manufacturing** is a process that involves quick production of parts using various manufacturing techniques. The process is characterized by low cost and customization².

**Additive manufacturing** is a process that involves creating an object by building it one layer at a time. It is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing, in which an object is created by cutting away at a solid block of material until the final product is complete. Additive manufacturing uses digital design and can save material¹.

I hope this helps!
