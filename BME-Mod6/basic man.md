**Sand Casting** is a process that involves pouring molten metal into a sand mold cavity. The mold is then allowed to cool and solidify, after which the sand is removed to reveal the final product. This process is used to create **engine blocks**, **cylinder heads**, **pump housings**, and other large metal parts¹.

**Forging** is a process that involves shaping metal by applying compressive forces using a hammer or a press. This process is used to create **aircraft parts**, **automotive parts**, **hand tools**, and other metal parts that require high strength and durability¹.

**Rolling** is a process that involves passing metal through a pair of rollers to reduce its thickness or change its shape. This process is used to create **structural shapes**, **plates**, **sheets**, and other metal products¹.

**Extrusion** is a process that involves forcing metal through a die to create a specific shape. This process is used to create **window frames**, **door frames**, **railings**, and other metal products¹.
