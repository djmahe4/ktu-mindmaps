Here's the revised version:

---

**General Exam Tip:**
*   **Keywords are King:** Underline keywords in the question and use them in your answer.
*   **Structure:** Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs.
*   **Articles (if remembered):** Mentioning key Article numbers adds weight (e.g., Art 14, Art 19, Art 21, Art 32, Art 356, Art 368).
*   **Positive Language:** Frame answers constructively.

**Module – 1**

**1.) Define Constitution**

*   **What it is:** A Constitution is the **supreme law** of a country. It's a foundational legal document.
*   **What it does:**
    1.  Lays down the **framework** and principal functions of the organs of government (Legislature, Executive, Judiciary).
    2.  Defines the **powers** of each organ and demarcates their responsibilities.
    3.  Regulates the **relationship** between these organs, and also between the government and the people.
    4.  Often includes a list of **fundamental rights** and duties of citizens.
*   **In essence:** It's the "Rulebook" or "Operating Manual" for a nation.
*   **Memory Aid:** **"Con-Rules"** (Constitution = Rules). Or think of it as the **"DNA of a Nation"** – it defines its structure and functioning.

---

**2.) Salient features of Indian constitution**

*   **Mnemonic Idea:** **"DR. FLIPS - SSS"** (or make your own from keywords)
    *   **D**rawn from Various Sources: "Borrowed" best features from many constitutions (UK, USA, Ireland, Canada, etc.) but adapted to Indian needs.
    *   **R**igidity and Flexibility: A mix. Some parts easy to amend (simple majority), some difficult (special majority + state ratification - Art 368).
    *   **F**ederal System with Unitary Bias: Federal (division of powers between Centre & States) but strong Centre (Emergency powers, single citizenship, All-India Services). *Think: "Team India (Centre) is captain, but States have roles."*
    *   **L**engthiest Written Constitution: Very detailed, covering diverse needs of a vast country.
    *   **I**ndependent Judiciary: Supreme Court & High Courts are independent to protect Constitution & FRs. Power of Judicial Review.
    *   **P**arliamentary Form of Government: Executive (Council of Ministers) is responsible to the Legislature (Lok Sabha). President is nominal head, PM is real head.
    *   **S**ecular State: State has no official religion; treats all religions equally. (Preamble, Art 25-28).
    *   **S**ingle Citizenship: All Indians are citizens of India, not of their respective states.
    *   **S**ynthesis of Parliamentary Sovereignty & Judicial Supremacy: Parliament can make laws, but Judiciary (SC) can declare them unconstitutional (if violating basic structure/FRs).
*   *Others:* Fundamental Rights (Part III), Directive Principles (Part IV), Fundamental Duties (Part IVA), Universal Adult Franchise.

**3.) Importance of Preamble of the constitution**

    3.  **Nature of State:** Declares India as **Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic.** *Mnemonic: **S-S-S D R***
    4.  **Guiding Light:** Helps in interpretation of ambiguous provisions of the Constitution.
    5.  **Indicator of Basic Structure:** Key elements of the Preamble are part of the basic structure.
*   **Memory Aid:** Think of the Preamble as the **"Mission Statement"** of India. It tells you *what* India aims to be and *why* the Constitution was made.

*   Citizenship Act, 1955, prescribes ways of acquiring citizenship:

*   Citizenship Act, 1955, also provides for loss of citizenship:
    *   **Mnemonic:** **R T D** (Like "Retired" or "Rooted Out")
        1.  **R**enunciation: A citizen voluntarily gives up Indian citizenship (e.g., after acquiring foreign citizenship).
        2.  **T**ermination: If a citizen voluntarily acquires citizenship of another country, their Indian citizenship automatically terminates.
        3.  **D**eprivation: Compulsory termination by the Central Government if citizenship was obtained by fraud, or if the citizen shows disloyalty, or unlawfully trades/communicates with an enemy during war, etc.

**Module – 2**

**1.) Define State (Article 12)**

    2.  The **Government and Legislature of each State** (State Executive & Legislature).

    4.  All **Other Authorities** within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India (e.g., statutory bodies like LIC, ONGC, PSUs, and even non-statutory bodies if they are an "instrumentality or agency" of the State).
*   **Memory Aid:** Think **"GPL-O"** (Govt. & Parliament/Legislature, Local, Other Authorities). Or "State is **EVERYWHERE** the government acts or has significant control."

        4.  Right to Freedom of **R**eligion (Art 25-28)
        5.  **C**ultural and Educational Rights (Art 29-30)
        6.  Right to **C**onstitutional Remedies (Art 32)
*   (Right to Property was a FR, but deleted by 44th Amendment, now a legal right under Art 300A).

---

**3.) Right to equality (Articles 14-18)**

*   **Art 14:** **Equality before law** (no one is above the law) AND **Equal protection of laws** (equals should be treated equally; reasonable classification allowed). *Memory: "All are 1 (one) before law."*

**4.) Right to Right to constitutional remedies (Art 32)**

*   **What it is:** Called the "Heart and Soul" of the Constitution by Dr. Ambedkar. It's the right to move the **Supreme Court** for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.
*   **Why Important:** Makes FRs real. Without remedies, rights are meaningless.
*   **Writs:** The SC (under Art 32) and High Courts (under Art 226) can issue directions, orders, or writs.
    *   **Mnemonic for Writs:** **"He May Produce Certified Quotes"** or **"H M P C Q"**
        1.  **H**abeas Corpus: ("To have the body of") Issued to produce a person illegally detained before the court and release them if detention is illegal. *Memory: "Where's the Body?"*
        2.  **M**andamus: ("We command") Issued to a public official/body/lower court to perform a public or statutory duty they have failed or refused to perform. *Memory: "Do Your Duty!"*
        3.  **P**rohibition: ("To forbid") Issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal to prevent it from exceeding its jurisdiction or acting contrary to natural justice. *Memory: "Stop! Don't Go There!"*

*   **Nature:**
    *   **Non-justiciable** (Art 37): Cannot be enforced through courts if violated.
    *   But **fundamental in the governance** of the country. It's the duty of the State to apply these principles.
*   **Examples:** Equal pay for equal work (Art 39d), Uniform Civil Code (Art 44), organization of village panchayats (Art 40), protection of environment (Art 48A), promotion of international peace (Art 51).

        *   Majority of total membership of each House AND majority of not less than 2/3rds of members present and voting in each House.
        *   Most provisions are amended this way (e.g., FRs, DPSPs).
    3.  **By Special Majority of Parliament + Ratification by at least Half of the State Legislatures (by simple majority):**
        *   For provisions affecting the federal structure.
        *   E.g., Election of President, extent of executive power of Union/States, SC & HCs, distribution of legislative powers, any of Lists in 7th Schedule, representation of states in Parliament, Art 368 itself.
