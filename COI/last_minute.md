<br>
**Module – 1**<br>
<br>
**1.) Define Constitution**<br>
    *   **What it is:** A Constitution is the **supreme law** of a country. It's a foundational legal document.<br>
    *   **What it does:**<br>
        1.  Lays down the **framework** and principal functions of the organs of government (Legislature, Executive, Judiciary).<br>
        2.  Defines the **powers** of each organ and demarcates their responsibilities.<br>
        3.  Regulates the **relationship** between these organs, and also between the government and the people.<br>
        4.  Often includes a list of **fundamental rights** and duties of citizens.<br>
    *   **In essence:** It's the "Rulebook" or "Operating Manual" for a nation.<br>
    *   **Memory Aid:** **"Con-Rules"** (Constitution = Rules). Or think of it as the **"DNA of a Nation"** – it defines its structure and functioning.<br>
<br>
**2.) Salient features of Indian constitution**<br>
    *   **Mnemonic Idea:** **"DR. FLIPS - SSS"** (or make your own from keywords)<br>
        *   **D**rawn from Various Sources: "Borrowed" best features from many constitutions (UK, USA, Ireland, Canada, etc.) but adapted to Indian needs.<br>
        *   **R**igidity and Flexibility: A mix. Some parts easy to amend (simple majority), some difficult (special majority + state ratification - Art 368).<br>
        *   **F**ederal System with Unitary Bias: Federal (division of powers between Centre & States) but strong Centre (Emergency powers, single citizenship, All-India Services). *Think: "Team India (Centre) is captain, but States have roles."*<br>
        *   **L**engthiest Written Constitution: Very detailed, covering diverse needs of a vast country.<br>
        *   **I**ndependent Judiciary: Supreme Court & High Courts are independent to protect Constitution & FRs. Power of Judicial Review.<br>
        *   **P**arliamentary Form of Government: Executive (Council of Ministers) is responsible to the Legislature (Lok Sabha). President is nominal head, PM is real head.<br>
        *   **S**ecular State: State has no official religion; treats all religions equally. (Preamble, Art 25-28).<br>
        *   **S**ingle Citizenship: All Indians are citizens of India, not of their respective states.<br>
        *   **S**ynthesis of Parliamentary Sovereignty & Judicial Supremacy: Parliament can make laws, but Judiciary (SC) can declare them unconstitutional (if violating basic structure/FRs).<br>
    *   *Others:* Fundamental Rights (Part III), Directive Principles (Part IV), Fundamental Duties (Part IVA), Universal Adult Franchise.<br>
<br>
**3.) Importance of Preamble of the constitution**<br>
    *   **What it is:** The introductory statement, sets out guiding purpose, principles, and philosophy. "Soul" or "Identity Card" of the Constitution.<br>
    *   **Importance:**<br>
        1.  **Source of Constitution:** Declares "We, the people..." as the source of authority.<br>
        2.  **Objectives:** Spells out the basic objectives: **Justice** (social, economic, political), **Liberty** (thought, expression, belief, faith, worship), **Equality** (status, opportunity), **Fraternity** (dignity, unity & integrity). *Mnemonic: **J-L-E-F** (Justice, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity)*<br>
        3.  **Nature of State:** Declares India as **Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic.** *Mnemonic: **S-S-S D R***<br>
        4.  **Guiding Light:** Helps in interpretation of ambiguous provisions of the Constitution.<br>
        5.  **Indicator of Basic Structure:** Key elements of the Preamble are part of the basic structure.<br>
    *   **Memory Aid:** Think of the Preamble as the **"Mission Statement"** of India. It tells you *what* India aims to be and *why* the Constitution was made.<br>
<br>
**4.) Types of citizenship**<br>
    *   Indian Constitution provides for **Single Citizenship**.<br>
    *   Citizenship Act, 1955, prescribes ways of acquiring citizenship:<br>
        *   **Mnemonic:** **B D R - N I** (Like a person's initials or a code)<br>
            1.  **B**y **B**irth: Born in India (with certain conditions).<br>
            2.  **B**y **D**escent: Born outside India to Indian citizen parents (with registration).<br>
            3.  **B**y **R**egistration: For persons of Indian origin, or married to Indian citizens, residing in India for a specified period.<br>
            4.  **B**y **N**aturalization: For foreigners who fulfill certain qualifications (residence, character, language).<br>
            5.  **B**y **I**ncorporation of territory: If a new territory becomes part of India, its people become citizens.<br>
<br>
**5.) Loss of citizenship**<br>
    *   Citizenship Act, 1955, also provides for loss of citizenship:<br>
        *   **Mnemonic:** **R T D** (Like "Retired" or "Rooted Out")<br>
            1.  **R**enunciation: A citizen voluntarily gives up Indian citizenship (e.g., after acquiring foreign citizenship).<br>
            2.  **T**ermination: If a citizen voluntarily acquires citizenship of another country, their Indian citizenship automatically terminates.<br>
            3.  **D**eprivation: Compulsory termination by the Central Government if citizenship was obtained by fraud, or if the citizen shows disloyalty, or unlawfully trades/communicates with an enemy during war, etc.<br>

**Module – 2**<br>
<br>
**1.) Define State (Article 12)**<br>

    *   **Memory Aid:** Think **"GPL-O"** (Govt. & Parliament/Legislature, Local, Other Authorities). Or "State is **EVERYWHERE** the government acts or has significant control."<br>
<br>
**2.) List out fundamental Rights**<br>
    *   Found in **Part III** of the Constitution (Articles 12-35). These are basic human rights guaranteed to all citizens (some to non-citizens too). They are **justiciable** (enforceable in court).<br>
    *   **Main Categories:**<br>
        *   **Mnemonic:** **"Every Free Citizen Reads Constantly & Carefully"**<br>
            1.  Right to **E**quality (Art 14-18)<br>

<br>
**3.) Right to equality (Articles 14-18)**<br>
    *   **Art 14:** **Equality before law** (no one is above the law) AND **Equal protection of laws** (equals should be treated equally; reasonable classification allowed). *Memory: "All are 1 (one) before law."*<br>
    *   **Art 15:** Prohibition of discrimination on grounds **only** of **R**eligion, **R**ace, **C**aste, **S**ex, **P**lace of birth (RR-CSP) in access to public places, etc. Allows special provisions for women & children, and for socially/educationally backward classes (SEBCs), SCs, STs. *Memory: "No RR-CSP bias."*<br>

    *   **Why Important:** Makes FRs real. Without remedies, rights are meaningless.<br>
    *   **Writs:** The SC (under Art 32) and High Courts (under Art 226) can issue directions, orders, or writs.<br>
        *   **Mnemonic for Writs:** **"He May Produce Certified Quotes"** or **"H M P C Q"**<br>

            5.  **Q**uo Warranto: ("By what authority or warrant") Issued to inquire into the legality of a person's claim to a public office. Prevents illegal usurpation of public office. *Memory: "Who Are You To Be Here?"*<br>
<br>

    *   **What they are:** These are **guidelines or instructions** given to the State (Central, State, Local Govts) to keep in mind while framing laws and policies.<br>
    *   **Aim:** To establish a **socio-economic democracy** – a welfare state.<br>

        *   **Non-justiciable** (Art 37): Cannot be enforced through courts if violated.<br>

**7.) Amendment of the Constitution (Art 368)**<br>
    *   Constitution needs to adapt to changing needs. Art 368 provides the procedure.<br>
    *   **Who can amend:** Parliament. (State Legislatures cannot initiate amendments, except for resolution to create/abolish Legislative Council).<br>
    *   **Procedure (Three Ways):**<br>
        1.  **By Simple Majority of Parliament:**<br>
            *   Like an ordinary law. Outside the scope of Art 368.<br>
            *   E.g., Admission/establishment of new states, creation/abolition of Legislative Councils, citizenship, salaries of MPs.<br>
        2.  **By Special Majority of Parliament:**<br>
            *   Majority of total membership of each House AND majority of not less than 2/3rds of members present and voting in each House.<br>
            *   Most provisions are amended this way (e.g., FRs, DPSPs).<br>
        3.  **By Special Majority of Parliament + Ratification by at least Half of the State Legislatures (by simple majority):**<br>
            *   For provisions affecting the federal structure.<br>
            *   E.g., Election of President, extent of executive power of Union/States, SC & HCs, distribution of legislative powers, any of Lists in 7th Schedule, representation of states in Parliament, Art 368 itself.<br>
    *   **Basic Structure Doctrine:** (Kesavananda Bharati case, 1973) Parliament cannot amend the "basic structure" or fundamental features of the Constitution (e.g., supremacy of Constitution, secular character, federalism, separation of powers, judicial review, parliamentary system).<br>
    *   **Memory Aid:** **"3 Ways to Change, but Core (Basic Structure) Stays!"**<br>
