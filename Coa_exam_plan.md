        *   **Addressing Modes:** Explicitly mentioned, frequently tested in detail (Part B) and Part A.
        *   **Bus Structures (Single vs Multiple Bus Org):** Explicitly mentioned, core comparison topic, control sequence questions are very common (Part B).
        *   **Instruction Execution/Sequencing/Cycle:** Explicitly mentioned, steps and control signals frequently asked (Part B and Part A). Instruction representation (3/2/1 address) also falls here.
    *   **MODERATELY IMPORTANT:**
        *   Functional Units, Memory locations/addresses/operations, Basic operational concepts: Foundational knowledge, likely tested in Part A or implicitly within Part B questions.
*   **Conclusion (M1):** Focus heavily on Addressing Modes, Bus Organization (esp. control sequences), and Instruction Execution.

**Module 2: Register transfer logic & Processor logic design**

*   **Syllabus:** Inter-register transfer, arithmetic/logic/shift micro-operations, processor organization, ALU design (arithmetic/logic circuit), status register, shifter design, accumulator design.
*   **Analysis:** Focuses on the building blocks of the processor.
    *   **MODERATELY IMPORTANT:**
        *   **ALU Design/Concepts:** Includes arithmetic/logic circuit design, status register, shifter. These often appear together in Part B questions (e.g., design status register for an ALU, design shifter).
        *   **Processor Organization (Accumulator based):** Explicitly mentioned, tested in Part B occasionally.
    *   **IMPORTANT for PART A / FOUNDATIONAL:**
        *   **Micro-operations (Arithmetic, Logic, Shift):** Explicitly mentioned, frequently tested in Part A, fundamental for understanding RTL.
        *   **Register Transfer Logic:** Foundational concept.
*   **Conclusion (M2):** Key Part B topics are the *design* aspects (ALU, Status Register, Shifter, Accumulator). Micro-operations are essential for Part A and basic understanding.

**Module 3: Arithmetic algorithms & Pipelining**

*   **Syllabus:** Multiplication/Division (Restoring, Booth's), Array multiplier, Pipelining (principles, classification, instruction/arithmetic pipelines, *hazard detection/resolution*). *Note: Design examples for pipelines not required.*
*   **Analysis:** Core algorithms and performance enhancement.
    *   **HIGHLY IMPORTANT:**
        *   **Booth's Multiplication Algorithm:** Explicitly mentioned, very frequently tested with examples (Part B).
        *   **Pipelining Hazards:** Explicitly mentions "hazard detection and resolution". This is the most heavily tested aspect of pipelining (identifying hazards in code, explaining resolution techniques like forwarding/stalling) (Part B).
    *   **MODERATELY IMPORTANT:**
        *   **Array Multiplier:** Explicitly mentioned, appears occasionally (Part B, often lower marks).
        *   **Restoring Division:** Explicitly mentioned, appears less frequently than Booth's, often in Part A or lower marks in Part B.
        *   Pipelining Principles/Classification: Foundational for understanding hazards (Part A / intro to Part B).
*   **Conclusion (M3):** Prioritize Booth's algorithm and Pipeline Hazards/Resolution. Array multiplier and Restoring Division are secondary but syllabus topics.

**Module 4: Control Logic Design**

*   **Syllabus:** Control organization, Hardwired control, Microprogram control (control of processor unit, sequencer, CPU organization, horizontal/vertical microinstructions).
*   **Analysis:** How control signals are generated.
    *   **HIGHLY IMPORTANT:**
        *   **Hardwired Control:** Explicitly mentioned, concepts and design steps frequently tested (Part B).
        *   **Micro-programmed Control:** Explicitly mentioned. Focus on the **Microprogram Sequencer** (diagram/function) and comparison of **Horizontal/Vertical microinstructions**. These are common Part B topics.
*   **Conclusion (M4):** Both Hardwired and Micro-programmed control are critical. Focus on the specific elements mentioned (sequencer, microinstruction types).

**Module 5: I/O organization & Memory system**

*   **Syllabus:** I/O access (interrupts, interrupt hardware, DMA), Memory concepts, RAM, ROM, CAM, Cache memories, mapping functions.
*   **Analysis:** Data transfer and storage hierarchy.
    *   **HIGHLY IMPORTANT:**
        *   **Direct Memory Access (DMA):** Explicitly mentioned, very frequently tested (Part B).
        *   **Cache Memory Mapping Functions:** Explicitly mentioned (Direct, Associative, Set-Associative), core topic frequently tested with explanations/comparisons (Part B).
    *   **MODERATELY IMPORTANT:**
        *   **Interrupts:** Explicitly mentioned, concept and steps often in Part A, sometimes linked to I/O mechanisms in Part B.
        *   **RAM/ROM:** Explicitly mentioned. Structure (DRAM/SRAM), internal chip organization, and types are tested (Part A / Part B).
    *   **LESS IMPORTANT:**
        *   **Content Addressable Memory (CAM):** Explicitly mentioned, but appears infrequently in exams.
*   **Conclusion (M5):** Focus heavily on DMA and Cache Mapping. Interrupts and RAM/ROM concepts are important secondary topics. CAM is lower priority based on exam frequency.
