Okay, that's a smart way to think about exam strategy. Since you only need to answer *one* full question (usually comprising two parts, a & b) out of the two offered for each module in Part B, you *can* potentially focus your deep study within a module if topics consistently appear as alternatives.

Let's revisit the modules and past patterns with this filtering strategy in mind:

**Module 1: Basic Structure & Processing Unit**

*   **Common Pairing:** Addressing Modes vs Bus Organization/Control Sequences.
*   **Observation:** Questions on Bus Organization (Single/Multi) *very frequently* involve writing control sequences. Addressing Modes are often tested with detailed explanations and examples.
*   **Filtering Idea:** You *could* aim to become an expert in EITHER all Addressing Modes OR Bus Organizations + Control Sequences.
*   **Risk:** High. Control sequences might appear even in the addressing mode question (e.g., "Write control sequence for STORE R1, [R2]" which uses register indirect addressing). Addressing modes are fundamental and might be needed implicitly elsewhere.
*   **Recommendation:** It's safer to study both, but if forced to prioritize *deep* study for Part B, pick the one you find easier and ensure you can nail *any* question on it. Mastering control sequences for common instructions seems slightly more versatile as it ties into bus organization directly.

**Module 2: Register Transfer & Processor Logic Design**

*   **Common Pairing:** Questions often mix-and-match ALU components (Arithmetic circuit, Logic Circuit, Status Register, Shifter) and Accumulator concepts. Less distinct pairing compared to other modules.
*   **Observation:** It's rare to see a question *only* on, say, Shifter design vs a question *only* on Status Register design. They are often combined or paired with Accumulator logic.
*   **Filtering Idea:** Difficult to filter specific topics reliably here.
*   **Recommendation:** Aim for a working knowledge of all major components (ALU circuits, Status Reg, Shifter, Accumulator logic/organization). You probably can't afford to completely skip one of these.

**Module 3: Arithmetic Algorithms & Pipelining**

*   **Common Pairing:** Booth's Algorithm vs Other Arithmetic (Array Multiplier / Restoring Division) OR Booth's/Hazards vs Other Arithmetic/Pipeline Basics. Pipelining Hazards are almost always present in one of the questions.
*   **Observation:** Booth's is a very frequent Part B topic. Pipeline Hazards (Identification & Resolution) are also extremely common.
*   **Filtering Idea:** This is the **best module for filtering**. Focus intensely on **Booth's Algorithm** (flowchart, examples) and **Pipeline Hazards** (identification in code, resolution techniques).
*   **Recommendation:** You can likely *de-prioritize* deep study of Array Multipliers and Restoring Division for Part B if you are confident in Booth's and Hazards. You should still know the basics for Part A.

**Module 4: Control Logic Design**

*   **Common Pairing:** Hardwired Control (Methods/Design) vs Micro-programmed Control (Sequencer/Org/Instruction Types).
*   **Observation:** These two approaches are naturally distinct and form a common question pairing.
*   **Filtering Idea:** Another **good module for filtering**. Choose to become an expert in **EITHER** Hardwired Control design principles and methods **OR** Micro-programmed Control (especially the sequencer diagram/function and horizontal/vertical comparison).
*   **Recommendation:** Pick one and master it. Be prepared to answer a full 14-mark question on your chosen topic. Know the basics of the other for Part A.

**Module 5: I/O & Memory System**

*   **Common Pairing:** Cache Mapping vs DMA/IO OR Memory Org vs Cache/DMA.
*   **Observation:** Cache Mapping Functions and DMA concepts appear very frequently, often as alternatives or paired together.
*   **Filtering Idea:** A **reasonably good module for filtering**. Focus intensely on **Cache Mapping Functions** (Direct, Associative, Set-Associative - diagrams, comparison, pros/cons) and **DMA** (concept, why it's used, basic process).
*   **Recommendation:** You can likely de-prioritize deep study of specific ROM types, DRAM structure/refresh details, Interrupt hardware details, and CAM for Part B if you master Cache Mapping and DMA. Basic knowledge is still needed for Part A.

**Summary of Filtering Strategy & Caveats:**

*   **High Confidence Filtering:** Module 3 (Focus: Booth's & Hazards), Module 4 (Focus: EITHER Hardwired OR Micro-programmed), Module 5 (Focus: Cache Mapping & DMA).
*   **Lower Confidence Filtering:** Module 1 (Risky to skip Addressing Modes or Bus Org/Control Seq), Module 2 (Topics are often intertwined).
*   **Part A Impact:** This filtering strategy applies mainly to preparing for the high-mark Part B questions. Part A requires broader knowledge, so completely skipping topics, even lower-priority ones, is risky.
*   **Exam Variability:** Past patterns are a guide, not a guarantee. The examiners could change the pairings.
*   **Depth vs Breadth:** This strategy allows you to go deeper into selected high-probability Part B topics, potentially sacrificing some breadth. Ensure your chosen topics are mastered thoroughly.

Use this analysis to allocate your *deepest* study time, but don't neglect the fundamentals of the de-prioritized topics for overall understanding and Part A.
