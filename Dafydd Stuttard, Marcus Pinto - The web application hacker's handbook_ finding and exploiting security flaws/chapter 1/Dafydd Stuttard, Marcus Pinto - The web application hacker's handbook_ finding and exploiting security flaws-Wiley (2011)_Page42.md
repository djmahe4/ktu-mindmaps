### Web Application Security

Web applications are a major target for attackers, as they can provide access to sensitive data, such as financial information, customer records, and intellectual property. In order to protect web applications from attack, it is important to understand the common security vulnerabilities that they face.

Some of the most common web application security vulnerabilities include:

* **Broken authentication:** This occurs when an attacker is able to bypass the application's authentication mechanisms, such as the login page. This can allow the attacker to access sensitive data or functionality without authorization.
* **Broken access controls:** This occurs when an attacker is able to access data or functionality that they should not be able to access. This can happen due to a number of factors, such as misconfigured permissions or vulnerabilities in the application's code.
* **SQL injection:** This occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious SQL code into the application's input fields. This can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the database server, steal data, or even take control of the server.
* **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** This occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious code into the application's output. This code can then be executed by the user's browser, which can allow the attacker to steal data, hijack sessions, or even take control of the user's computer.

In order to protect web applications from these vulnerabilities, it is important to implement a number of security measures, such as:

* **Using strong passwords:** Passwords should be at least 8 characters long and should include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Implementing two-factor authentication:** Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to enter a code from their phone in addition to their password.
* **Keeping software up to date:** Software updates often include security patches that can fix vulnerabilities. It is important to install updates as soon as they are available.

## Key points

* **The majority of web applications are insecure.**
* **Common vulnerabilities include broken authentication, broken access controls, and SQL injection.**
* **Organizations should take steps to secure their web applications, such as using strong passwords, implementing access controls, and regularly scanning for vulnerabilities.**

## Explanation

The authors of the book "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook" have tested hundreds of web applications in recent years. They found that the majority of these applications were insecure, despite the widespread usage of SSL technology and the adoption of regular PCI scanning.

The most common vulnerabilities found in web applications are broken authentication, broken access controls, and SQL injection.

* **Broken authentication** occurs when an attacker is able to bypass the application's login mechanism. This can be done by guessing weak passwords, launching a brute-force attack, or exploiting a vulnerability in the login process.
* **Broken access controls** occur when the application fails to properly protect access to its data and functionality. This can allow an attacker to view other users' sensitive data, carry out privileged actions, or even take control of the application.
* **SQL injection** occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious SQL code into the application's input fields. This code can then be used to retrieve arbitrary data from the database, interfere with the application's logic, or even execute commands on the database server itself.

Organizations should take steps to secure their web applications, such as using strong passwords, implementing access controls, and regularly scanning for vulnerabilities.

* **Strong passwords** are essential for preventing attackers from guessing or brute-forcing their way into an application. Passwords should be at least 8 characters long and should include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
* **Access controls** should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data and functionality. This can be done by using role-based access control (RBAC), which grants users access to only the data and functionality that they need to perform their job.
* **Regular scanning** for vulnerabilities is essential for identifying and fixing security flaws before they can be exploited by attackers. There are a number of commercial and open source tools available for scanning web applications for vulnerabilities.

By taking these steps, organizations can help to protect their web applications from attack.
