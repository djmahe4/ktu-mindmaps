Web application security is a field of computer security that deals with the protection of web applications from attack. Web applications are a major target for attackers because they provide a way to access sensitive data, such as financial information, personal information, and intellectual property.

There are a number of different types of attacks that can be launched against web applications. Some of the most common attacks include:

* **SQL injection:** This is an attack where the attacker injects malicious SQL code into a web application. The malicious code can then be used to steal data from the application or to take control of the application.
* **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** This is an attack where the attacker injects malicious code into a web application that is then executed in the victim's browser. The malicious code can then be used to steal the victim's cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
* **Remote code execution (RCE):** This is an attack where the attacker is able to execute arbitrary code on the web server that hosts the web application. This can be used to steal data, take control of the server, or launch further attacks against other systems.

Web application security is a complex and challenging field. There are a number of different factors that contribute to the security of a web application, including:

* The design of the application: The design of the application should take into account security risks and should be implemented in a way that minimizes the risk of attack.
