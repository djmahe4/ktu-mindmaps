**Kohlberg's and Gilligan's Theories of Moral Development**

**Kohlberg's Theory**
*   **Structure:** Six stages across three levels of moral reasoning[2][8]
*   **Preconventional Level (ages 0-9 / 4-10 from slides):** Decisions based on self-interest and avoiding punishment [NewSource - Slide 67]
    *   Stage 1: Obedience and punishment orientation - Following rules to avoid punishment[2][8]
    *   Stage 2: Self-interest orientation (Instrumental Orientation) - Making decisions based on personal benefit/satisfying needs[8] [NewSource - Slide 67]
*   **Conventional Level (adolescence to adulthood / 10-13 from slides):** Decisions guided by social expectations and laws [NewSource - Slide 68]
    *   Stage 3: Interpersonal accord (Good Boy/Nice Girl) - Making decisions to meet social expectations and gain approval[8]. Emphasis on good behavior and interpersonal relationships. [NewSource - Slide 68]
    *   Stage 4: Authority and social order (Maintaining Social Order) - Following laws and rules to maintain societal order[2][8]. Understanding importance of society's rules and laws. [NewSource - Slide 68]
*   **Postconventional Level (some adults / 13+ from slides):** Decisions guided by higher principles [NewSource - Slide 69]
    *   Stage 5: Social contract and individual rights (Social-Contract Orientation) - Following socially agreed rules but recognizing their relativity[2][8]. Recognizing different societal values/laws, evaluating based on justice/fairness. [NewSource - Slide 69]
    *   Stage 6: Universal ethical principles - Making decisions based on abstract universal principles[2][8]. Operating on self-chosen abstract ethical principles (universal human rights, justice). [NewSource - Slide 69]
*   **Focus:** Justice, rights, and universal ethical principles as the basis for moral judgment[3]

**Gilligan's Theory**
*   **Critique of Kohlberg:** Argued that Kohlberg's theory was male-centered and did not adequately address women's moral development[3]. Believed Kohlberg studied privileged men/boys; women's moral development involves caring and human relationships. [NewSource - Slide 72]
*   **Alternative approach:** Care-based ethics focusing on relationships and responsibilities[3]
    *   **Pre-conventional Level:** Care for oneself to ensure survival; transition to finding connection between oneself and others. [NewSource - Slide 73]
    *   **Conventional Level:** Feels responsible and shows care towards other people (e.g., mother/wife role), sometimes ignoring self. [NewSource - Slide 73]
    *   **Post-conventional Level:** Principle of care for self as well as others is accepted. [NewSource - Slide 73]
*   **Key components:**
    *   Emphasizes relationships, empathy, and care in moral reasoning
    *   Views moral development as a complex interplay of care and responsibility (change of self rather than critical thinking) [NewSource - Slide 74]
    *   Considers the importance of context and connection in ethical decision-making[3]
*   **Application:** Rather than abstract principles, focuses on particular relationships and responsibilities

**Comparison**
*   Kohlberg emphasizes justice and universal principles while Gilligan emphasizes care and relationships[3] (Kohlberg: Justice-based; Gilligan: Care-based morality) [NewSource - Slide 76]
*   Kohlberg views moral development as linear progression through stages, while Gilligan sees it as more complex[3]
*   Kohlberg focuses on individual rights; Gilligan focuses on human connection and relationship responsibilities[3]

**Ethical Theories (Theories about Right Action)**
*   **Utilitarian Theory:** (John Stuart Mill [NewSource - Slide 87])
    *   Judges actions based on maximizing good consequences (happiness/pleasure for the greatest number).
    *   Involves weighing costs and benefits
    *   Action is right if it produces the greatest good for the greatest number[4]
    *   Application: Decisions based on outcome maximization (e.g., resource allocation)
*   **Duty Ethics (Deontological):** (Immanuel Kant [NewSource - Slide 90])
    *   Focuses on fulfilling duties and following rules universally with no exceptions.
    *   Actions are judged by adherence to moral obligations
    *   Right action comes from following moral rules regardless of consequences[4]
    *   Application: Professional codes of ethics, contractual obligations
*   **Rights Theory (Rights-Based Ethical Theory):** (John Locke [NewSource - Slide 89])
    *   Emphasizes respecting individuals' basic rights (to life, health, liberty, possession). "Live and let live."
    *   Includes rights to life, liberty, privacy, and property
    *   Actions are right if they respect these fundamental rights[4]
    *   Application: Intellectual property protection, privacy considerations
*   **Virtue Ethics:**
    *   Evaluates character and actions based on moral excellence
    *   Focuses on developing virtuous character traits
    *   Right actions are those a virtuous person would perform[4]
    *   Application: Professional integrity, honesty in reporting
*   **Justice Theory:**
    *   Examines whether actions are fair and impartial
    *   Considers distribution of benefits and burdens
    *   Actions are right if they maintain fairness and equity[4]
    *   Application: Fair treatment of employees, equitable resource allocation
*   **Golden Mean Ethics:** (Aristotle [NewSource - Slide 88])
    *   Solution to a problem found by analyzing reason and logic, seeking a "mean value" between extremes of excess and deficiency.
    *   Application: Balancing industrialization with environmental protection.

**Types of Inquiry**
*   **Normative Inquiry:** [NewSource - Slide 56]
    *   Focuses on what ought to be, not what is; examining and evaluating based on established norms/standards.
    *   Addresses questions about professional obligations, rights, and responsibilities
    *   Example application: Determining appropriate engineer response to safety concerns
*   **Conceptual Inquiry:** [NewSource - Slide 57]
    *   Clarifies meaning of concepts and ideas (e.g., safety, risk, bribe, profession).
    *   Analyzes how concepts relate to each other
    *   Example application: Understanding "risk," "safety," or "responsibility" in engineering contexts
*   **Factual/Descriptive Inquiry:** [NewSource - Slide 58]
    *   Investigates empirical facts relevant to ethical decisions (using mathematical/statistical techniques).
    *   Establishes what has happened or might happen (e.g., benefit assessment, risk assessment procedures, effects of pollution).
    *   Example application: Investigating causes of engineering failures
*   **Application in Engineering Ethics:**
    *   Complex ethical issues require integration of all three types of inquiry
    *   Factual inquiry establishes circumstances, conceptual inquiry clarifies terms, normative inquiry guides action
