#### Module 1: ER Model
- **Table Creation with Keys:** Shows how to define entities and relationships.
  - Create a table with a primary key:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Employees (EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(100), DepartmentID INT);
    ```
  - Add a foreign key to link tables:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Departments (DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY, DepartmentName VARCHAR(100));
    ALTER TABLE Employees ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID);
    ```
  - Enforce data integrity with constraints:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Products (ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY, ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, Price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (Price > 0));
    ```

#### Module 2: Relational Model
- **Database and Table Operations:** Demonstrates basic data management.
  - Create a database:  
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;
    ```
  - Create and manipulate table data:  
    ```sql
    USE CompanyDB;
    CREATE TABLE Employees (EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(100), Salary DECIMAL(10,2));
    INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);
    UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 55000 WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
    DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
    SELECT * FROM Employees;
    ```
  - Join tables to show relationships:  
    ```sql
    SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName FROM Employees JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
    ```

#### Module 3: SQL DML and Physical Data Organization

  - Aggregate data with grouping:  
    ```sql
    SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) as AverageSalary FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;
    ```
  - Use subqueries for nested logic:  
    ```sql
    SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
    ```
  - Create a view for reusable queries:  
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 60000;
    ```
  - Implement a trigger for automatic actions:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert BEFORE INSERT ON Employees FOR EACH ROW SET NEW.Salary = IF(NEW.Salary < 0, 0, NEW.Salary);
    ```
  - Add an index for performance:  
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Employees (Name);
    ```

#### Module 4: Normalization

  - Join multiple tables to reflect normalization:  
    ```sql
    SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderDate, OrderDetails.ProductID, OrderDetails.Quantity FROM Customers JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID;
    ```

#### Module 5: Transactions and NoSQL
- **Transaction Management:** Ensures data integrity.
  - Start and commit a transaction:  
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;
    COMMIT;
    ```
  - Set transaction isolation level:  
    ```sql
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
    ```
- **JSON Data Handling:** Mimics NoSQL flexibility in MySQL.

The analysis is based on extensive research into educational resources and practical examples, ensuring coverage of all relevant concepts as of April 23, 2025.

#### Background and Methodology
The task involved identifying MySQL queries that illustrate key DBMS concepts across five modules: ER Model, Relational Model, SQL DML, Normalization, and Transactions with NoSQL. The approach included reviewing tutorials, official documentation, and community resources to compile a comprehensive set of examples. Each query was selected to demonstrate specific functionalities, such as table creation, data manipulation, and advanced operations like triggers and JSON handling.

#### Detailed Query Examples by Module

##### Module 1: Introduction & Entity Relationship (ER) Model
This module focuses on the foundational aspects of DBMS, including entity sets, attributes, and relationships. The following queries demonstrate how to implement ER concepts in MySQL:

- **Table Creation with Primary and Foreign Keys:**  
  - Example:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Employees (EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(100), DepartmentID INT);
    CREATE TABLE Departments (DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY, DepartmentName VARCHAR(100));
    ALTER TABLE Employees ADD CONSTRAINT fk_department FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID);
    ```
    - **Explanation:** These queries show how to create tables with primary keys (unique identifiers for entities) and foreign keys (relationships between entities), aligning with ER model concepts like entity sets and relationships. The foreign key ensures referential integrity, a key aspect of ER design.

- **Enforcing Constraints:**  
  - Example:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Products (ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY, ProductName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, Price DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (Price > 0));
    ```
    - **Explanation:** This demonstrates constraints like NOT NULL (mandatory attributes) and CHECK (attribute constraints), reflecting ER model's focus on data integrity and entity attributes.

These examples were derived from resources like [Medium: Building The Basics: Primary key and Foreign key in MySQL](https://medium.com/@harshalyaravalkar4/building-the-basics-primary-key-and-foreign-key-in-mysql-20bb65bd2586), which provided syntax and practical implementations.

##### Module 2: Relational Model
This module covers the structure of relational databases, integrity constraints, and SQL operations. The following queries illustrate these concepts:

- **Database and Table Operations:**  
  - Example:  
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;
    USE CompanyDB;
    CREATE TABLE Employees (EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(100), Salary DECIMAL(10,2));
    INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Salary) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);
    UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 55000 WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
    DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
    SELECT * FROM Employees;
    ```
    - **Explanation:** These queries demonstrate DDL (Data Definition Language) operations like CREATE and DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT, aligning with relational model concepts of table structure and data manipulation.

- **Join Queries:**  
  - Example:  
    ```sql
    SELECT Employees.Name, Departments.DepartmentName FROM Employees JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
    ```
    - **Explanation:** This shows a JOIN operation, illustrating how relational algebra concepts like natural join are implemented in SQL, crucial for querying related data across tables.

Resources like [W3Schools: MySQL Joins](https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_join.asp) provided detailed examples, ensuring alignment with relational model topics.

##### Module 3: SQL DML, Physical Data Organization
This module delves into advanced SQL operations and physical data organization, including indexing. The following queries cover these areas:

- **Complex SELECT with Aggregation:**  
  - Example:  
    ```sql
    SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) as AverageSalary FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID HAVING AVG(Salary) > 50000;
    ```
    - **Explanation:** This query uses GROUP BY for aggregation and HAVING for filtering, demonstrating SQL DML capabilities for data analysis, a key aspect of this module.

- **Subqueries:**  
  - Examples:  
    - Non-correlated:  
      ```sql
      SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
      ```
    - Correlated (from research):  
      ```sql
      SELECT last_name, salary, department_id FROM employees outerr WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = outerr.department_id);
      ```
    - **Explanation:** Subqueries allow nested queries, with non-correlated ones executing independently and correlated ones depending on outer query values, aligning with SQL DML complexity.

- **Views and Triggers:**  
  - View example:  
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Salary > 60000;
    ```
  - Trigger example:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER before_employee_insert BEFORE INSERT ON Employees FOR EACH ROW SET NEW.Salary = IF(NEW.Salary < 0, 0, NEW.Salary);
    ```
    - **Explanation:** Views provide reusable queries, while triggers automate actions, both essential for advanced DML operations.

- **Indexing for Physical Organization:**  
  - Example:  
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_name ON Employees (Name);
    ```
    - **Explanation:** Indexing improves query performance, relating to physical data organization concepts like B-trees and hashing, though detailed algorithms were not required per the module.

Resources like [W3Resource: MySQL Subqueries](https://www.w3resource.com/mysql/subqueries/index.php) and [PhoenixNAP: How To Use MySQL Triggers](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/mysql-trigger) provided extensive examples.

##### Module 4: Normalization
Normalization focuses on reducing data anomalies through functional dependencies and normal forms. While primarily a design concept, queries can demonstrate its impact:

- **Querying Normalized Data:**  
  - Example:  
    ```sql
    SELECT Customers.Name, Orders.OrderDate, OrderDetails.ProductID, OrderDetails.Quantity FROM Customers JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID;
    ```
    - **Explanation:** This query shows how normalized schemas (e.g., separate tables for customers, orders, and details) require joins, reflecting lossless join and dependency preservation, key normalization concepts.

Given the theoretical nature, fewer direct queries were found, but this example aligns with practical application, as seen in general SQL tutorials.

##### Module 5: Transactions, Concurrency and Recovery, Recent Topics
This module covers transaction management and introduces NoSQL concepts, with MySQL's JSON support as a bridge:

- **Transaction Management:**  
  - Example:  
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID = 1;
    UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID = 2;
    COMMIT;
    ```
    - Additional:  
      ```sql
      SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
      ```
    - **Explanation:** These queries demonstrate transaction control (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK) and isolation levels, ensuring ACID properties like atomicity and consistency, crucial for concurrency and recovery.

- **JSON Data Handling for NoSQL Concepts:**  
  - Create table:  
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Users (UserID INT PRIMARY KEY, UserData JSON);
    ```
  - Insert data:  
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Users (UserID, UserData) VALUES (1, '{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}');
    ```
  - Query data:  
    ```sql
    SELECT UserData->'$.name' AS Name FROM Users WHERE UserID = 1;
    ```
    - **Explanation:** These queries show MySQL's JSON support, mimicking NoSQL flexibility for semi-structured data, aligning with topics like Key-value and Document DBs (e.g., Redis, MongoDB).

Resources like [MySQLTutorial: MySQL Transactions](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-stored-procedure/mysql-transactions/) and [DigitalOcean: Working with JSON in MySQL](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/working-with-json-in-mysql) provided detailed examples, ensuring coverage of both relational and NoSQL aspects.
