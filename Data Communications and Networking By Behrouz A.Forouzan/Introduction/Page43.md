Here is a summary of the concepts of half-duplex and full-duplex communication, as well as networks:

* **Half-duplex communication** is a type of communication in which two devices can only transmit or receive data at one time. This is in contrast to full-duplex communication, in which two devices can transmit and receive data simultaneously.
* **Full-duplex communication** is typically used in cases where there is a need for two-way communication, such as in telephone calls or video conferencing. Half-duplex communication is typically used in cases where there is no need for two-way communication, such as in walkie-talkies or CB radios.
* **A network** is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes) connected by communication links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network.
* **Distributed processing** is a type of processing in which a task is divided among multiple computers. Instead of one single large machine being responsible for all aspects of a process, separate computers (usually a personal computer or workstation) handle a subset.
* **Network criteria** are the requirements that a network must meet in order to be effective. The most important of these are performance, reliability, and security.
* **Performance** is a measure of how well a network can handle the traffic that is sent over it. This can be measured in terms of transit time, response time, and throughput.
* **Reliability** is a measure of how likely a network is to experience outages or other disruptions. This can be measured in terms of availability, mean time between failures (MTBF), and mean time to repair (MTTR).
* **Security** is a measure of how well a network can protect its data from unauthorized access or disclosure. This can be measured in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Half-duplex**

In half-duplex communication, only one station can transmit at a time. The other station must wait for the first station to finish transmitting before it can transmit. This is in contrast to full-duplex communication, in which both stations can transmit at the same time.

Half-duplex communication is often used in situations where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time. For example, walkie-talkies are half-duplex devices. When two people are using walkie-talkies, one person can talk while the other person listens. When the first person is finished talking, the other person can start talking.

Half-duplex communication can also be used in situations where it is important to avoid interference between the two stations. For example, CB (citizens band) radios are half-duplex devices. When two people are using CB radios, they must take turns talking so that they do not interfere with each other.

**Full-duplex**

In full-duplex communication, both stations can transmit and receive at the same time. This is in contrast to half-duplex communication, in which only one station can transmit at a time.

Full-duplex communication is often used in situations where there is a need for communication in both directions at the same time. For example, a telephone call is a full-duplex communication. When two people are talking on the phone, they can both talk and listen at the same time.

Full-duplex communication can also be used in situations where it is important to avoid delays in communication. For example, a video conference is a full-duplex communication. When two people are participating in a video conference, they can both see and hear each other at the same time.

**Networks**

A network is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes) connected by communication links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network.

Networks are used to share information and resources. For example, a company might use a network to share files between employees, or a school might use a network to allow students to access the internet.

There are many different types of networks, including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and the internet.

**Distributed processing**

Distributed processing is a type of computing in which a task is divided among multiple computers. Instead of one single large machine being responsible for all aspects of a process, separate computers (usually a personal computer or workstation) handle a subset.

Distributed processing is often used to improve performance and reliability. For example, a web server might use distributed processing to handle requests from multiple users. If one computer fails, the other computers can continue to handle requests.

**Network criteria**

A network must be able to meet a certain number of criteria. The most important of these are performance, reliability, and security.

Performance is the ability of the network to handle the amount of traffic that is being sent through it. Reliability is the ability of the network to continue to operate even in the event of a failure. Security is the ability of the network to protect data from unauthorized access.

There are many different ways to improve the performance, reliability, and security of a network. Some common techniques include using high-speed links, redundant links, and firewalls.

### Key points

* Walkie-talkies and CB (citizens band) radios are both half-duplex systems.
* In half-duplex mode, only one station can transmit at a time.
* Full-duplex mode allows both stations to transmit and receive simultaneously.
* A network is a set of devices connected by communication links.
* Distributed processing divides a task among multiple computers.
* A network must be able to meet certain criteria, such as performance, reliability, and security.

### Half-duplex communication

Half-duplex communication is a type of communication in which only one station can transmit at a time. The other station must wait for the first station to finish transmitting before it can transmit. This is in contrast to full-duplex communication, in which both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.

Half-duplex communication is often used in situations where there is no need for communication in both directions at the same time. For example, walkie-talkies and CB (citizens band) radios are both half-duplex systems. When two people are using walkie-talkies, they must take turns talking. The person who is not talking must listen. This is because the walkie-talkies only have one channel, and both people cannot talk at the same time without interfering with each other.

### Full-duplex communication

Full-duplex communication is a type of communication in which both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously. This is in contrast to half-duplex communication, in which only one station can transmit at a time.

Full-duplex communication is often used in situations where there is a need for communication in both directions at the same time. For example, the telephone network is a full-duplex system. When two people are talking on the phone, they can both talk and listen at the same time. This is because the telephone network has two channels, one for sending and one for receiving.

### Networks

A network is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes) connected by communication links. A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network.

Networks are used to share information and resources. For example, a company might use a network to share files between employees, or a university might use a network to allow students to access library resources.

### Distributed processing

Distributed processing is a type of computing in which a task is divided among multiple computers. Instead of one single large machine being responsible for all aspects of a process, separate computers (usually a personal computer or workstation) handle a subset.

Distributed processing can be used to improve performance, reliability, and security. For example, a distributed database can be used to improve the performance of a website by spreading the load across multiple servers.

### Network criteria

A network must be able to meet a certain number of criteria. The most important of these are performance, reliability, and security.

* Performance: A network must be able to handle the amount of traffic that is placed on it.
* Reliability: A network must be able to keep working even when there are problems.
* Security: A network must be able to protect data from unauthorized access.
