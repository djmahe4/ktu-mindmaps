Data communications is the process of sending and receiving data from one device to another. It is used in a variety of applications, including telecommunications, computer networking, and industrial automation.

Data communications can be divided into two main categories: analog and digital. Analog data is continuous, while digital data is discrete. Analog data is represented by a physical quantity, such as voltage or current, that varies continuously over time. Digital data is represented by a series of discrete values, such as 0s and 1s.

Analog data communications is typically used for applications where the quality of the signal is important, such as voice and music. Digital data communications is typically used for applications where the speed of the signal is important, such as computer networking.

Data communications can be carried over a variety of media, including wired and wireless media. Wired media includes twisted pair cable, coaxial cable, and fiber optic cable. Wireless media includes radio waves, microwaves, and infrared light.

The choice of media depends on a variety of factors, including the distance between the communicating devices, the amount of data to be transmitted, and the cost of the media.

**Data Communications**

Data communications is the process of transferring data from one device to another. It can be done through a variety of media, including wired and wireless connections.

**Data Representation**

Information today comes in different forms such as text, numbers, images, audio, and video.

* Text: In data communications, text is represented as a bit pattern, a sequence of bits (Os or Is). Different sets of bit patterns have been designed to represent text symbols. Each set is called a code, and the process of representing symbols is called coding. Today, the prevalent coding system is called Unicode, which uses 32 bits to represent a symbol or character used in any language in the world. The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), developed some decades ago in the United States, now constitutes the first 127 characters in Unicode and is also referred to as Basic Latin. Appendix A includes part of the Unicode.
* Numbers: Numbers are also represented by bit patterns. However, a code such as ASCII is not used to represent numbers; the number is directly converted to a binary number to simplify mathematical operations. Appendix B discusses several different numbering systems.
* Images: Images are also represented by bit patterns. In its simplest form, an image is composed of a matrix of pixels (picture elements), where each pixel is a small dot. The size of the pixel depends on the resolution. For example, an image can be divided into 1000 pixels or 10,000 pixels. In the second case, there is a better representation of the image (better resolution), but more memory is needed to store the image. After an image is divided into pixels, each pixel is assigned a bit pattern. The size and the value of the pattern depend on the image. For an image made of only black-and-white dots (e.g., a chessboard), a 1-bit pattern is enough to represent a pixel. If an image is not made of pure white and pure black pixels, you can increase the size of the bit pattern to include gray scale. For example, to show four levels of gray scale, you can use 2-bit patterns. A black pixel can be represented by 00, a dark gray pixel by 01, a light gray pixel by 10, and a white pixel by 11. There are several methods to represent color images. One method is called RGB, so called because each color is made of a combination of three primary colors: red, green, and blue. The intensity of each color is measured, and a bit pattern is assigned to it. Another method is called YCM, in which a color is made of a combination of three other primary colors: yellow, cyan, and magenta.
* Audio: Audio refers to the recording or broadcasting of sound or music. Audio is by nature different from text, numbers, or images. It is continuous, not discrete. Even when we record sound, we do so at a finite number of samples per second. This means that the original sound is being approximated by a series of discrete samples. The higher the sampling rate, the more accurate the approximation will be.

**Protocols**

A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications. It represents an agreement between the communicating devices. Without a protocol, two devices may be connected but not communicating, just as a person speaking French cannot be understood by a person who speaks only Japanese.

**Types of Protocols**

There are many different types of protocols, each designed for a specific purpose. Some common types of protocols include:

* **Data link protocols:** These protocols control the physical link between two devices. They ensure that data is transmitted correctly and without errors.
* **Network protocols:** These protocols control the flow of data between devices on a network. They ensure that data is delivered to the correct destination.
* **Transport protocols:** These protocols provide a reliable connection between two applications. They ensure that data is not lost or corrupted in transit.
* **Application protocols:** These protocols are used by applications to communicate with each other. They define the format of data and the rules for exchanging data.
