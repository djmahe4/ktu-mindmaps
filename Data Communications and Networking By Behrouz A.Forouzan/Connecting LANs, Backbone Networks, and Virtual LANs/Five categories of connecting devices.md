Sure, let's go through each of them:

1. **Passive Hub**: A passive hub is a basic network device that connects multiple devices together. It does not process or regenerate signals, but simply repeats or copies the signals it receives. It's essentially a connector that connects wires coming from other devices.

2. **Repeater**: A repeater is a networking device that amplifies and regenerates the incoming signal. Its main purpose is to extend the networking distance by increasing the strength and quality of signals.

3. **Active Hub**: An active hub, also known as a powered hub or an intelligent hub, strengthens the signal where a passive hub just repeats or copies signals. It needs electricity to operate and is smarter than a passive hub. It's a multi-point repeater with the capability of regenerating signals and can process and monitor information.

4. **Two-Layer Switch (Layer 2 Switch)**: A two-layer switch operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. It sends frames to the destination port using a MAC address table which stores the MAC addresses of devices associated with that port.

5. **Router**: A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It manages traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allows multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.

6. **Three-Layer Switch (Layer 3 Switch)**: A three-layer switch is a special network device that has the functionality of a router and a switch combined into one chassis. It operates at both the data link layer (Layer 2) and the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model.

7. **Gateway**: A gateway is a connecting point of any network that helps it to connect with different networks. It monitors and controls all the incoming and outgoing traffic of the network.
