#Types of os
# 1. Batch Operating System (Mnemonic: BATCH)

Bundled jobs
Automated execution
Time delay
Cheap for large tasks
Human interaction absent

Advantages:

Efficient for large jobs.

Reduces CPU idle time.

Automates job execution.


Disadvantages:

No user interaction.

Debugging is hard.

Time-consuming for small tasks.



---

# 2. Time-Sharing OS (Mnemonic: TIME)

Terminals used
Interactive system
Multiprogramming
Equal time slots

Advantages:

Interactive and responsive.

Efficient resource usage.

Reduces idle time.


Disadvantages:

Complex to manage.

Security and data integrity issues.

CPU time is shared, which may cause delays.



---

# 3. Distributed OS (Mnemonic: DISTRIBUTED)

Decentralized system
Interconnected computers
Sharing resources
Task distribution
Reliability improved
Increases throughput
Better performance
User-transparent
Troubleshooting hard
Expensive
Data sync needed

Advantages:

Resource sharing.

High performance and reliability.

Load balancing.


Disadvantages:

Expensive setup.

Complex system management.

Security and consistency issues.



---

# 4. Network OS (Mnemonic: NETWORK)

Nodes connected
Each device independent
Terminal access
Workgroup support
Off-site file access
Resource sharing
Known central admin

Advantages:

Centralized data access.

Security and administration.

Easy integration of devices.


Disadvantages:

Expensive servers.

Dependent on central server.

Less fault-tolerant than distributed OS.



---

# 5. Real-Time OS (Mnemonic: REAL)

Responds instantly
Embedded systems
Always on time
Low latency

Advantages:

Fast and predictable response.

Ideal for critical systems (e.g., medical, defense).

Minimal system latency.


Disadvantages:

Very complex design.

Limited task flexibility.

Expensive to implement.
