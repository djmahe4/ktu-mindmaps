### Application-Level Questions with Answers

#### Module 1: Introduction & Entity Relationship (ER) Model
**Question 1:** What is a Database Management System (DBMS)? Explain its characteristics.  
**Answer:** A DBMS is software that enables users to create, manage, and manipulate databases. Its characteristics include data independence, data integrity, security, concurrency control, and backup and recovery mechanisms.

**Question 2:** What is the Entity-Relationship (ER) model? Describe its components.  
**Answer:** The ER model is a conceptual framework used to describe the structure of a database with entities, attributes, and relationships. Entities are objects or concepts, attributes are properties of entities, and relationships define associations between entities.

**Question 3:** Explain the difference between structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.  
**Answer:** Structured data is highly organized and fits into predefined models like tables. Semi-structured data has some organizational properties but doesn't fit into rigid schemas, such as JSON or XML. Unstructured data lacks a predefined format, including text, documents, and images.

#### Module 2: Relational Model
**Question 1:** What is the difference between the SELECT and PROJECT operations in relational algebra?  
**Answer:** The SELECT operation (σ) retrieves rows that satisfy a specified condition, while the PROJECT operation (π) retrieves specific columns from a relation.

**Question 2:** Write an SQL query to create a table named 'Students' with columns StudentID (primary key), Name, and Age.  
**Answer:**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Age INT
);
```

**Question 3:** Explain the differences between DROP, TRUNCATE, and DELETE commands in SQL.  
**Answer:** DROP removes the entire table from the database. TRUNCATE removes all rows from a table but retains the table structure. DELETE removes specific rows based on a condition and can be rolled back if used within a transaction.

#### Module 3: SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language), Physical Data Organization
**Question 1:** Write a query to find all employees who earn more than the average salary in their department.  
**Answer:**  
```sql
SELECT e1.EmployeeID, e1.Name, e1.Salary
FROM Employees e1
WHERE e1.Salary > (
    SELECT AVG(e2.Salary)
    FROM Employees e2
    WHERE e2.DepartmentID = e1.DepartmentID
);
```

**Question 2:** What is an index in DBMS? How does it improve query performance?  
**Answer:** An index is a data structure that provides quick access to rows in a table based on the values in one or more columns. It improves query performance by allowing the database to find data without scanning the entire table.

#### Module 4: Normalization
**Question 1:** What is normalization in DBMS? Why is it important?  
**Answer:** Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.

**Question 2:** Explain the different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) with examples.  
**Answer:**  
- **1NF (First Normal Form):** Ensures that each column contains atomic values and there are no repeating groups.  
- **2NF (Second Normal Form):** Builds on 1NF by ensuring that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.  
- **3NF (Third Normal Form):** Ensures that there are no transitive dependencies; i.e., non-key attributes do not depend on other non-key attributes.  
- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):** A stricter version of 3NF where every determinant is a candidate key.

#### Module 5: Transactions, Concurrency and Recovery, Recent Topics
**Question 1:** What are the ACID properties of a transaction? Explain each.  
**Answer:**  
- **Atomicity:** Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit, which either completes entirely or not at all.  
- **Consistency:** Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.  
- **Isolation:** Ensures that transactions are executed in isolation from each other.  
- **Durability:** Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

**Question 2:** What is NoSQL? How does it differ from traditional relational databases?  
**Answer:** NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases do not use a fixed schema and often provide horizontal scalability and flexible data models.
